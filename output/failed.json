Charlie's recording software malfunctioned and lost his audio so we needed to use the entire call audio recording which, paired with Discord latency and taking fan calls, was not high quality. Regardless, thank you for supporting the show for 300 episodes. We really appreciate everyone who's taken the time to watch an episode, or those of you who have watched from the start.
